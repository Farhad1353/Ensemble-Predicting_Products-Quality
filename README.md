# Ensemble-optimisation-using-hyperparameter-and-architecture-search
This is an ensemble project to establish different Red Wines quality based on 11 different features for each wine given.

In order to execute this project you can run __Main.py__ for a fast result(using Ctrl+F5).
However, for better visiualization, comments and flowchart diagram I'll certainly recommend to run __Main__.ipynb.

There is 3 more .py codes that can be executed as a first stage of the ensemble model(You do not have to run this, as it has been executed at least once each and did send the necessary info to CSV files(in Data subfolder) for 2nd stage of the ensemble process) : RF_1st_stage.py, AB_1st_stage.py and GB_1st_stage. Running this 3 codes will overwrite the previous data in RandomForest_reg.csv, AdaBoost_reg.csv and GradientBoosting_reg.csv.
